      <h2>About This Project</h2>

      <h3>Problem</h3>
      <p>
        Students often misplace personal belongings on campus and have difficulty recovering them due to the lack
        of a centralized and user-friendly lost-and-found system. Traditional methods such as handing items to security
        or posting on bulletin boards are frequently ignored or overlooked.
      </p>

      <h3>Innovation</h3>
      <p>
        An interactive web platform where students submit lost items by entering a description and tagging the exact
        spot on a campus map. The system provides a searchable, shareable list of reported items and icons on the map,
        increasing the chance of recovery and promoting cooperation.
      </p>

      <h3>HCI Angle</h3>
      <p>
        Focus on user interaction with the map, accessible form fields, clear icons and legend, and quick search filters.
        The prototype emphasizes easy input, mobile-responsive UI, and minimal steps to report an item.
      </p>

      <h3>Prototype</h3>
      <p>
        An interactive campus map prototype (can be developed in Figma for full visual design). The web prototype here
        allows students to tag locations, submit item details, and find reported items in real time (stored locally).
